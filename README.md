# Cover Letter Generator
What does the website do?
The scope of this project is to create a personal cover letter generator as I will soon be applying for graduate jobs, all current Cover Letter generators cost at least Â£0.90 per document, so this will be a great project to improve my JS skills within ReactJS, introduce myself to tailwind and get to use the OpenAI API.
